                        <p>The importance of information and efficient information management is steadily increasing due to the evolution of new technologies and high-capacity storage media but also because growing market dynamics raise information needs. Online police station and criminal management system is an e-government related service and it makes the communication process a possibility, a great success for modern era which increases the professional efficiency for the government police administration. All the police stations keep records of case such as case detail, victim details, suspect list etc. They also stores case related documents such as post mortem reports, crime scene images , collected videos, crime scene found objects etc. Again to solve a case they need to store criminal details such as name , father name, address etc and criminal related documents such as criminal images, fingerprint, passport or NID copy etc. In many cases it is seen that two or more police stations are involved and need to communicate and co-operate with each other. Some cases can be solved in less time with the information provided by common people. So we need to take common people and police at single platform for easy communication and assistance. Again all police stations should be automated and centralized for ease of communication and co-operation.</p>
        <p>Online police station and criminal management system provides a total computerized information system support for the work of police station. This system provides all the detailed information about case and criminal. It also manages case and criminal related documents with user friendly approach. Online police station and criminal management system enables  all the police stations to co-operate with each other, easy share of case and criminal related records very easily.
